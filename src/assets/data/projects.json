I created Chefs Journal as a social media platform for foodies and anyone who loves to cook. Users can create recipes, explore recipes and other userâ€™s work of art, as well as connecting with them.",
        "My goal was to push myself outside my comfort zone and build on the skills I learnt at BrainStation Bootcamp. I built this full stack web app using my skills on frontend and backend. Frontend was built using React, and SCSS for styling. Backend was built using Node and Express along with MySQL database. User authentication is done using Google OAuth and Passport. Deployed via hosting on Digital Ocean."
